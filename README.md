# Machine-Learning-Project
This is a project which is based on CNN (Which is deep learning algorithm).
The dataset which is used in this project was from kaggle site named as plant-village
dataset which has the data of various crops and among all these data, tomato leaf
dataset was used for this project.
This project basically detects the faulty leaves from tomato tree
so that plants can be treated accordingly as there are 12 types of diseases
that can happen to tomato leaves and by doing all these steps, the yield of 
crop can be increased which will impact our overall tomato production and 
we will get healthy and good tomatoes to eat, the accuracy of this project is 96%.(approx)
